At the conference, we presented our project on urban greening and sustainable transport in Singapore. We collected nationwide Google Street View images, applied image segmentation to compute the Green View Index (GVI), and integrated GVI into routing and network analysis. This provides valuable insights for promoting urban greening and enhancing green mobility options.
