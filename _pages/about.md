Hello! This is Yixuan Zhang. I hold a Master’s degree in Science from the [National University of Singapore](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/geog/), and a Bachelor’s degree from [Wuhan University](https://sres.whu.edu.cn/), China.

My research interests include spatiotemporal analysis, health geography, and GeoAI. My current research, conducted at [NUS GeoSpatialX Lab](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/geospatialx/), focuses on modeling international trade with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and evaluating the environmental impact of trade activities.

I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs and am open to collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my work!
